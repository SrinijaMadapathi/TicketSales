<p>This is a full-fledged ASP.NET MVC web application with all ingredients as a precursor to the Entity Framework.
        You can turn around and later create this as a database application which is the objective. therefore, understanding the objects amd classes and how they interact
        with other classes and objects in the framework is really important.
</p>
<p>
    This application has three controllers, siz views with a shared layout and five models. In addition, there are more models that have constructors, which deserve your special attention and understanding.
